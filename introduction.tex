\todo{MMW: I think it might be worth iterating with Mike Heroux on this introductory session.}
Trilinos is a community-driven, open-source C++ software framework and collection of reusable scientific libraries designed to enable the development of scalable, high-performance algorithms for solving complex, multiscale, and multiphysics engineering and scientific problems on advanced computing architectures.
While Trilinos can run on a variety of hardware ranging from small workstations to large supercomputers, the typical use of Trilinos is on the leadership-class systems with new or emerging hardware architectures.

% History
Trilinos was originally conceived as a framework of three packages for distributed memory systems. The original Trilinos publication~\cite{Heroux2005a} describes the motivation, philosophy, and capabilities of Trilinos at that time. A few years later, the second Trilinos overview publication~\cite{Heroux2012} introduced the expanded set of capabilities then included in Trilinos as well as the strategic goals for Trilinos. Trilinos today is similar to the Trilinos that was envisioned two decades ago in some aspects. However, it is also very different in several other aspects. These changes were necessitated by the changes in programming models, application needs, hardware architectures, and algorithms. Trilinos has grown from a library of three packages to a library with more than fifty packages with functionality and features supporting a wide range of applications.
\todo{Check how many packages?}

% Purpose
This article is an attempt to capture a snapshot of where Trilinos is today as opposed to twenty and thirteen years ago when the original Trilinos articles were written. Therefore it will focus on the major developments within Trilinos in the last decade as well as new features and functionality that have been added to advance scientific and engineering applications. It will only give an overview of the features, and we refer to the extensive list of references for the details of these features. We are also cognizant of the fact that this article describes software that is actively developed and hence could become outdated even before its publication. Hence, we will focus on the high level features and project that we expect to remain stable for several years.



\subsection{Modern Trilinos}

%\todo{MMW: I think we should spend some time in this section outlining the motivation for our Kokkos approach, explaining the proliferation of node architectures, the Kokkos revolution, and what this has meant for Trilinos.  I think this is worth its own subsection. }

One of the primary goals of modern Trilinos is to provide a performance-portable stack of reusable scientific libraries, which enable users to write applications that are highly efficient on all modern High Performance Computing (HPC) hardware architectures.

This goal emerged when the HPC architecture landscape started diversifying with the
introduction of GPU acceleration for scientific software. Today 9 of the top 10 systems in the Top500\footnote{https://top500.org} use GPUs, with only a single system being CPUs only. A complication in this shift is the diversification of vendor-provided programming models.
\todo{Are these numbers and programming models up-to-date?}
The aforementioned 10 systems actually have four different preferred programming models: CUDA, HIP and OneAPI SYCL for the GPU based systems and OpenMP for the CPU system.

To avoid the necessity of diverging code paths, Trilinos is leveraging the Kokkos Ecosystem~\cite{trott2021kokkos} to write hardware-agnostic code. The Kokkos Ecosystem started as the native Trilinos packages Kokkos and Kokkos Kernels but split off a decade ago into a standalone project hosted at \url{https://github.com/kokkos}.
However, Trilinos provides snapshots of the two primary Kokkos subprojects which reflect the latest release of Kokkos. Trilinos can also be built against version-compatible external installations of Kokkos --- a capability required for interoperability with other Kokkos-based libraries.

Kokkos enables Trilinos developers to write single source implementations of their packages that perform well on all major HPC hardware architectures. Some of its design principles are also reflected in Trilinos API designs. In particular the
use of \texttt{execution} and \texttt{memory spaces} as parameters of data structures and algorithms is a common thread through many packages. This design characteristic enables Trilinos users to manage the heterogeneity of modern architectures and its impact on Trilinos data structures.

\subsection{Trilinos Functionality}

%Product and package structure
The functionalities in Trilinos are organized in two levels. The first one is \textit{package}. A package in Trilinos has a well-defined set of unique capabilities that is important for scientific or engineering applications. Packages also have a set of expectations such as having a responsible point of contact or a package lead, software engineering expectations such as documentation, continuous integration testing, clearly defined dependencies, using the Trilinos infrastructure for building and installation etc. The packages are then aggregated into \emph{products} for organizational ease. We currently have these collections: Core, Linear Solvers and Preconditioners, Nonlinear Solvers and Analysis Tools, Discretization Tools, and Framework. These products are collections of packages that share a common objective (e.g., solving a linear system of equations), a sub-community within Trilinos, and in some cases common interfaces. This article is structured around these product areas, which are briefly described below.

\paragraph{Core} Core packages cover all aspects of creating, distributing or mapping data to processing elements (cores, threads, nodes), load balancing, and redistributing data. They also include Trilinos abstractions for linear algebra data structures and algorithms and concrete implementations such as Tpetra linear algebra data structures. On a modern accelerator-based compute node, the abstractions provided by the Kokkos library become critical for Tpetra. This product area is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:data_services}.
 
\paragraph{Linear Solvers and Preconditioners} The wide variety of applications that use Trilinos need a diverse set of linear solvers. Trilinos has support for both iterative and direct linear solvers, including interfaces to external solver packages. There are a number of preconditioner options from multithreaded or performance portable node-level preconditioners to scalable multilevel domain decomposition or multigrid preconditioners. The preconditioners and solvers use the data abstractions from the core packages. Section \ref{sec:lin_solve} provides a detailed description of these features.

\paragraph{Nonlinear Solvers and Analysis Tools} These packages provide high level algorithms for computational simulation and design. Capabilities include solvers for nonlinear equations, parameter continuation, bifurcation tracking, optimization and uncertainty quantification. This capability area also provides lower level utility packages to evaluate quantities of interest required by the analysis algorithms. Capabilities include automatic differentiation technology to evaluate derivatives and embedded ensemble propagation for uncertainty quantification. The capabilities in this area will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:nonlin_solve}.

\paragraph{Discretizations} This collection of packages provides tools for the discretization of differential equations. In particular, it supports mesh-free and mesh-based spatial discretizations, with a focus on high-order finite elements, and time integration. Discretization tools also include cross-cutting utilities for algorithmic differentiation and for managing directed acyclic graphs of evaluation kernels. These tools are described in Section~\ref{sec:discretization} in detail.

\paragraph{Framework} The Framework product is different than the other Trilinos products in that most of the resources and services are not associated with Trilinos packages. The Framework product rather is focused primarily on activities such as developing and maintaining infrastructure for automated testing and documentation, as well as associated workflows. A small number of infrastructure and cross-cutting packages are also associated with the Framework, including Teuchos and PyTrilinos2. Section~\ref{sec:framework} provides further details.


\vspace{2.0ex} This article describes Trilinos' product areas and their packages with a focus towards providing an overview of recent developments. We also briefly touch upon the Trilinos community (Section~\ref{sec:community}) and software engineering issues with respect to Trilinos.
